## Machine-Learning-under-Kiril-E ##

The repo consists of python codes of all the the learnings ensued while pursuing the Udemy coursework on Machine Learning under Kiril Eremenko.  
Spanning from the simplest Linear Regression to the complex ANNs and Convolution Neural Network for identifying images, it's a collection of well-written codes that serve as templates as well for easy reproduction in other more complex projects requiring a combination of algorithms and other steps.
