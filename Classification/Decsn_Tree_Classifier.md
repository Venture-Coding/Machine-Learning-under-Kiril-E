### Decision Tree Classifier ###

The backbone of Random Forests(one of the most favorite models in Machine Learning) are the Decision Trees.    
There are 4 popular types of decision tree algorithms: 
i)   ID3,  
ii)  CART (Classification and Regression Trees),  
iii) Chi-Square and   
iv)  Reduction in Variance


Graphically, it simply splits the data into smaller and smaller compartments until it completely overfits(or has reached specified max depth).

Various Tree - Based Models are used in Machine Learning : 
1. Random Forests  
2. Bagging (Mean, Median, Mode of multiple sub-sampled models)    
3. Boosting (Avg, Wtd avg, Majority of Weak Learners)  
4. Gradient Boosting  
5. Extreme GB
