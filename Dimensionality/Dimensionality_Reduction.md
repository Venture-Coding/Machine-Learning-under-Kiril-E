Primarily, there's a need to reduce dimensions to as low as necessary, to avoid the "curse of dimensionality."  
The lesser the dimensions, the better it is for the algorithm to work efficiently for memory and speed, taking up less space and time.  
  
The 2 Major Types :  
1. Feature Selection.  
2. Feature Extraction  

Feature Selection further includes...  
i)   Backward Elimination  
ii)  Forward Selection  
iii) Bidirectional Elimination  
iv)  Score Comparison  
  
  
Feature Extraction includes...  
i)   Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
ii)  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)   
iii) Kernel PCA   
iv)  Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)  
v)   Autoencoders

  
  
Dimensionality reduction is common in fields that deal with large numbers of observations and/or large numbers of variables, such as signal processing, speech recognition, neuroinformatics, and bioinformatics.
