## Principal Component Analysis ##
   
The aim is to select the Principal Components that matter to the solution. This is done by identifying the Principal Component Axis along which there is maximum variation and it his then plotted to lower dimensions. The loss in information by not considering other PC Axes is negligible compared to the gains achieved in this reduction. Basically it's just plotting data such that we can capture the maximum variance across any of the features. The features that give us max variation are the ones containing max imformation important for discriminating across the data.
