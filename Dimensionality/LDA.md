## Linear Discriminant Analysis ##

LDA is a further improvement on PCA wherein we not only find the principal axes but also ensures to maximize the separation between mulitple classes.  
It projects the feature-space onto a lower dimensional space while maintaining the class-discriminatory information.  
While both PCA & LDA are linear techniques, LDA is kind of supervised, given it's relation to the independent variable while the PCA is more unsupervised.
